    "# Fine-Tuning Gemma 3 1B Instruct: Complete Guide 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the comprehensive guide for fine-tuning Google's Gemma 3 1B Instruct model! This notebook will walk you through the entire process of customizing a pre-trained language model for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn:\n",
    "- Understanding fine-tuning vs training from scratch\n",
    "- Setting up the environment for different devices (CPU, CUDA, Apple Silicon)\n",
    "- Loading and preparing the Gemma 3 1B Instruct model\n",
    "- Creating and formatting training datasets\n",
    "- Implementing LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "- Training with different optimization techniques\n",
    "- Evaluating and testing your fine-tuned model\n",
    "- Saving and sharing your custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "- Python 3.8 or higher\n",
    "- At least 16GB of RAM (32GB+ recommended)\n",
    "- GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (or Apple Silicon with 16GB+ unified memory)\n",
    "- HuggingFace account and token for Gemma access\n",
    "- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts"

    "## Step 1: Understanding Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's understand what fine-tuning means and why it's powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **What is Fine-Tuning?**\n",
    "Fine-tuning takes a pre-trained model and adapts it to your specific task or domain by training it on your custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Types of Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "- **Full Fine-Tuning**: Updates all model parameters (expensive, high quality)\n",
    "- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Updates only small adapter layers (efficient, good quality)\n",
    "- **Prompt Tuning**: Learns optimal prompts (very efficient, task-specific)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Why Fine-Tune Gemma 3 1B Instruct?**\n",
    "- Smaller model = faster training and inference\n",
    "- Good performance for many tasks\n",
    "- Fits in consumer hardware\n",
    "- Already instruction-tuned for better baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Device Considerations:**\n",
    "- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**: Great for LoRA fine-tuning, unified memory advantage\n",
    "- **NVIDIA GPUs**: Excellent for all types of fine-tuning\n",
    "- **CPU Only**: Possible but slow, best for very small datasets"

    "## Step 11: Pre-Training Verification and Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 What this cell does:**\n",
    "This step performs critical pre-training checks to prevent common training failures, then starts the actual fine-tuning process. The verification fixes have been essential for resolving gradient computation issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 What happens inside:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-training Verification (Critical Fixes):**\n",
    "- **Training Mode**: Ensures model is ready for gradient computation\n",
    "- **LoRA Gradient Setup**: Verifies all LoRA parameters can receive gradients\n",
    "- **Cache Disabling**: Prevents conflicts between caching and gradient checkpointing\n",
    "- **Token Synchronization**: Aligns tokenizer settings with model configuration\n",
    "- **Gradient Testing**: Performs a test forward/backward pass to verify training will work\n",
    "- **Generation Testing**: Checks the model doesn't immediately produce EOS tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actual Training Process:**\n",
    "- **Training Execution**: Starts the full fine-tuning process\n",
    "- **Progress Monitoring**: Shows training progress, loss, and evaluation metrics\n",
    "- **Time Tracking**: Measures actual training duration\n",
    "- **Model Saving**: Automatically saves the best model based on validation loss\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles interruptions and saves partial progress\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚙️ What you can monitor during training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Progress Indicators:**\n",
    "- **Training Loss**: Should generally decrease over time\n",
    "- **Evaluation Loss**: Should decrease and stay close to training loss\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: Will follow cosine schedule (high → low)\n",
    "- **Step Time**: Time per training step (should be consistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Training Signs:**\n",
    "- Loss decreases steadily in early steps\n",
    "- Evaluation loss tracks training loss closely\n",
    "- No \"NaN\" or \"inf\" values in losses\n",
    "- Memory usage remains stable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning Signs:**\n",
    "- Loss increases or stays flat\n",
    "- Large gap between train and eval loss (overfitting)\n",
    "- Very slow training (check device utilization)\n",
    "- Memory errors (reduce batch size and restart)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛑 If training fails:**\n",
    "The cell includes comprehensive error handling and will try to save partial progress. Common solutions:\n",
    "- **Out of memory**: Reduce batch_size in Step 9, restart from Step 10\n",
    "- **Gradient errors**: The pre-training verification should prevent these\n",
    "- **Slow training**: Check that your device (GPU/MPS) is actually being used\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Training duration expectations:**\n",
    "- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2)**: 15-45 minutes for demo dataset\n",
    "- **Modern GPU**: 5-15 minutes for demo dataset  \n",
    "- **CPU only**: 1-3 hours for demo dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Expected output:**\n",
    "You should see pre-training verification passes, training progress bars, decreasing loss values, and successful model saving to the output directory."

    "\n",
    "**🎯 What this cell does:**\n",
    "This comprehensive testing cell compares your fine-tuned model against the original base model to evaluate training success. It tests both models with the same questions and shows you the differences side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 What happens inside:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 - Base Model Loading:**\n",
    "- Downloads and loads the original Gemma 3-1B model (without your fine-tuning)\n",
    "- Uses the same device and precision settings as your fine-tuned model\n",
    "- Provides a clean baseline for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 - Model Verification:**\n",
    "- Confirms your fine-tuned model is available and ready\n",
    "- Ensures both models are properly configured for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 - Side-by-Side Testing:**\n",
    "- Tests both models with 5 diverse questions covering different domains\n",
    "- Uses proper isolation techniques to prevent response contamination\n",
    "- Shows responses from both models for direct comparison\n",
    "- Provides immediate analysis of each comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 - Evaluation Guidance:**\n",
    "- Explains how to interpret the results\n",
    "- Describes what successful fine-tuning looks like\n",
    "- Identifies potential issues and their meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚙️ Understanding the test questions:**\n",
    "The cell tests diverse topics to evaluate general knowledge retention:\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Tests if fine-tuning improved AI knowledge\n",
    "- **Cooking**: Tests practical everyday knowledge  \n",
    "- **Science**: Tests factual scientific knowledge\n",
    "- **Biology**: Tests educational content understanding\n",
    "- **Programming**: Tests technical knowledge retention\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 What good results look like:**\n",
    "- **Different Responses**: Fine-tuned model gives different (hopefully better) answers than base model\n",
    "- **Coherent Output**: Both models produce readable, relevant responses\n",
    "- **No Empty Responses**: Both models generate meaningful content (not just EOS tokens)\n",
    "- **Domain Appropriateness**: Responses match the question topics\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Potential issues and what they mean:**\n",
    "- **Identical Responses**: Fine-tuning may not have been effective (data size, learning rate, epochs)\n",
    "- **Empty Responses**: Token generation issues (usually fixed by our training setup)\n",
    "- **Worse Responses**: Possible overfitting or inappropriate training data\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Quality**: Normal variation, but consistent patterns may indicate training issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔧 If you see problems:**\n",
    "- **No differences**: Increase epochs, learning rate, or dataset size in previous steps\n",
    "- **Quality degradation**: Reduce learning rate or add more diverse training data\n",
    "- **Empty outputs**: Check that Step 11 completed successfully\n",
    "- **Generation errors**: Restart the kernel and rerun from Step 11\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Expected output:**\n",
    "You should see successful loading of both models, followed by detailed comparisons showing your fine-tuned model producing different and ideally improved responses compared to the original model."
